Within our Data Leaders in Internal Audit LinkedIn Group, we will be having our Tuesday Webclass.

This upcoming Tuesday, we'll be talking about “S4 versus ECC-how much do we need to change our data analytics?”

If your organization is going to move to S4- will you need to change all of your data analytics or just a few? If you have outsourced data analytics-how much should you expect to pay for the update? What will be the impact in terms of speed of execution? What can the auditor help the entity to check when the system is switched over?

Make sure to join us on Tuesday 1st August at 9:00 AM EST.
